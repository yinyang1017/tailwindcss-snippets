### Credits
This collection of snippets would have not been possible without the hard work of many talented engineers and designers. It would only be fair to give back credit to the authors that inspired some of the snippets:Â 

* This project started as a port of [ui-snippets.dev](https://ui-snippets.dev/) for TailwindCSS, special kudos to Emil Kowalski for originally creating that.
* Gradient Tilt inspired by [linear.app](https://linear.app/).
* Underline Squiggle inspired by [edgeandnode.com](https://edgeandnode.com/).
